# Life Map Framework

*Inspired by Alex Lieberman's Life Map — a holistic framework for evaluating and designing your life across six key domains.*

---

## What This Is

Your life is not just your company. It's not just your career.

A life well-lived requires attention across multiple domains. Neglect one too long, and the others suffer.

This framework helps you:
- Evaluate where you are in six life domains
- Spot imbalances before they become crises
- Design intentional improvement in the areas that matter most

**The Six Domains:**
1. **Career / Work**
2. **Relationships**
3. **Health**
4. **Meaning / Purpose**
5. **Finances**
6. **Fun / Play**

---

## How To Use This Framework

**Frequency:**
- Complete the full Life Map **once per year** (during your annual review)
- Quick check-in **once per quarter** (score each domain 1-10, note changes)

**Instructions:**
For each domain, you'll answer:
1. **Current State:** Where are you right now? (1-10 score + description)
2. **Ideal State:** What would a 10/10 look like for you?
3. **Gap Analysis:** What's missing? What's working?
4. **One Action:** What's one thing you can do in the next 90 days to improve this domain?
