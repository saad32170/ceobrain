# Annual Review Framework

*Adapted from Dr. Anthony Gustin's Annual Review methodology — a structured approach to reflecting on the past year and planning the next with clarity and depth.*

---

## What This Is

This is a comprehensive, once-per-year reflection designed to help you:
- Acknowledge what happened (good and bad)
- Extract lessons and patterns
- Let go of what didn't work
- Clarify what you want next
- Set clear, grounded intent for the coming year

**Time required:** 3-4 hours, ideally uninterrupted.

**When to do this:** Late December or early January, when you have space to think.

---

## Part 1: Reflection on the Past Year

### 1.1 Highlights

*What were the peak moments, biggest wins, and things you're genuinely proud of?*

List at least 5-10. Be specific.

- [e.g., "Closed our largest enterprise deal ($500K ARR)"]
- [e.g., "Hired a VP of Eng who's better than me at building teams"]
- [e.g., "Took two weeks fully offline with family"]

### 1.2 Lowlights

*What were the hardest moments, biggest disappointments, or failures?*

Be honest. No one else is reading this.

- [e.g., "Missed revenue target by 30%"]
- [e.g., "Lost two senior engineers due to burnout"]
- [e.g., "Avoided a co-founder conversation for 6 months"]

### 1.3 What Drained You Most

*What consistently pulled energy without giving back?*

- [e.g., "Internal politics between sales and product"]
- [e.g., "Managing underperformers I should have let go sooner"]
- [e.g., "Constant context-switching between strategy and ops"]

### 1.4 What Energized You Most

*What gave you momentum, clarity, or joy?*

- [e.g., "Closing deals personally"]
- [e.g., "Deep work sessions designing strategy"]
- [e.g., "Mentoring younger founders"]

### 1.5 Decisions You're Proud Of

*What did you decide that felt hard but right?*

- [e.g., "Walked away from a partnership that looked good on paper but felt wrong"]
- [e.g., "Said no to Series A so we could stay profitable"]
- [e.g., "Fired a toxic high performer"]

### 1.6 Decisions You Regret (or Delayed)

*What did you avoid, defer, or get wrong?*

- [e.g., "Should have hired a finance lead in Q1, waited until Q4"]
- [e.g., "Kept a product line alive too long out of sunk cost fallacy"]
- [e.g., "Didn't set boundaries with a demanding customer"]

---

## Part 2: Key Lessons Learned

*What did this year teach you?*

Write 3-5 clear, actionable lessons. These should be specific enough that you can reference them in future decisions.

1. [e.g., "I make better decisions when I have space to think. Protecting CEO time isn't optional."]
2. [e.g., "Speed matters, but not at the expense of fit. Hiring fast and firing slow is still my default mistake."]
3. [e.g., "Revenue growth doesn't fix cultural problems. Culture is foundational, not optional."]

---

## Part 3: Letting Go

*What are you consciously choosing to leave behind?*

This could be beliefs, habits, goals, relationships, or ways of working that no longer serve you.

- [e.g., "The belief that I have to be involved in every decision"]
- [e.g., "The habit of checking Slack on weekends"]
- [e.g., "The goal of being seen as the 'hardest worker in the room'"]

---

## Part 4: What You Want Next Year

### 4.1 Professional Goals

*What do you want to achieve in [YOUR COMPANY]?*

Be specific. Use numbers where possible.

- [e.g., "Hit $15M ARR with 70%+ gross margin"]
- [e.g., "Build a leadership team that runs the business without me"]
- [e.g., "Make a decision on Series A by Q2"]

### 4.2 Personal Goals

*What do you want for yourself, outside of work?*

- [e.g., "Take 4 weeks of true vacation"]
- [e.g., "Run a sub-4:00 marathon"]
- [e.g., "Write 50,000 words (essays, reflections, book draft)"]

### 4.3 Identity and Role Shift

*How do you want your role to evolve?*

- [e.g., "Move from operator to strategist"]
- [e.g., "Transition from lead salesperson to sales leader"]
- [e.g., "Spend 50% of my time on partnerships and growth, 0% on product"]

### 4.4 What You Want to Feel

*How do you want to feel at the end of next year?*

- [e.g., "Proud that I built sustainably, not just fast"]
- [e.g., "Energized by the team I've built"]
- [e.g., "Clear on what's next, whether that's scale or exit"]

## Part 5: One-Year Vision

*Write a short narrative (3-5 paragraphs) describing what success looks like one year from now.*

Imagine it's December 31, [NEXT YEAR]. You're doing your annual review. What happened? What's true? How do you feel?

Be specific. Use present tense.

Example:

*"It's December 31, 2026. We hit $15M ARR with 72% gross margin. I hired a world-class COO in Q1 who runs operations better than I ever did. I closed three enterprise deals personally and then transitioned all future deals to our VP of Sales. I protected Tuesdays for deep work and didn't check Slack on weekends. I took three full weeks off — two with family, one solo to write. I feel clear, energized, and proud. The business is healthy. The team is strong. I know what I'm optimizing for."*

Your turn:

[Write your one-year vision here]

## Part 6: Three Focus Areas for Next Year

*From everything above, distill into three clear focus areas.*

These should guide every major decision you make.

1. [e.g., "Revenue execution — hit $15M ARR through enterprise sales and retention"]
2. [e.g., "Leadership team — hire COO and CFO, empower them fully"]
3. [e.g., "CEO energy — protect deep work time, delegate ops, work sustainably"]

---

## How To Use This Framework

1. Block 3-4 hours of uninterrupted time
2. Work through each section honestly
3. Save this file in `reviews/annual/[YEAR]-annual-review.md`
4. Reference it quarterly to check alignment
5. Use Part 6 (Three Focus Areas) as your decision filter for the year

---

*This is not a performance review. It's a conversation with yourself about what matters.*
