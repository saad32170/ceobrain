# Ideal Life Costing Framework

*Inspired by Tim Ferriss's "Dreamlining" exercise from The 4-Hour Workweek — a practical method for designing your ideal lifestyle and calculating what it actually costs.*

---

## What This Is

Most people optimize for income without defining what they actually want.

This framework flips that: **You design your ideal lifestyle first, then calculate what it costs.**

The result is clarity. You might discover your ideal life costs less than you think. Or you might realize you need more. Either way, you'll know what you're working toward.

**Time required:** 1-2 hours for the first pass. 30 minutes annually to update.

## How This Works

You'll design your ideal lifestyle across three categories:
1. **Being** — Who do you want to be? (skills, identity, growth)
2. **Having** — What do you want to have? (possessions, experiences, assets)
3. **Doing** — What do you want to do? (activities, routines, travel)

For each item, you'll estimate:
- **Monthly cost** (if recurring)
- **One-time cost** (if it's a purchase or experience)
- **Time required** (to acquire or maintain it)

Then you'll calculate your **Target Monthly Income (TMI)** — the amount you need to sustain your ideal life.

## Part 1: Being

*Who do you want to become? What skills, capacities, or identities do you want to develop?*

Examples:
- "Fluent in Spanish"
- "Able to run a marathon"
- "Confident public speaker"
- "Skilled investor"

List 5-10 things you want to be:

1. [YOUR GOAL]
2. [YOUR GOAL]
3. [YOUR GOAL]
4. [YOUR GOAL]
5. [YOUR GOAL]

**For each one, estimate:**
- What would it cost to develop this? (courses, coaching, training)
- How much time would it take? (hours per week, months to achieve)

---

## Part 2: Having

*What do you want to own or have access to?*

Examples:
- "A home office with natural light and great gear"
- "A reliable, comfortable car (not flashy)"
- "A vacation home in [PLACE]"
- "A wardrobe that makes getting dressed easy"

List 5-10 things you want to have:

1. [ITEM] — One-time cost: $[X] | Monthly cost: $[X]
2. [ITEM] — One-time cost: $[X] | Monthly cost: $[X]
3. [ITEM] — One-time cost: $[X] | Monthly cost: $[X]
4. [ITEM] — One-time cost: $[X] | Monthly cost: $[X]
5. [ITEM] — One-time cost: $[X] | Monthly cost: $[X]

**Total one-time cost:** $[SUM]  
**Total monthly cost:** $[SUM]

## Part 3: Doing

*What do you want to do regularly?*

This is your lifestyle design — the activities, routines, and experiences that make life feel rich.

Examples:
- "Take one week-long trip per quarter"
- "Have dinner with family five nights per week"
- "Train with a personal coach twice per week"
- "Attend one conference per year in a place I want to explore"
- "Host a monthly dinner with close friends"

List 5-10 things you want to do:

1. [ACTIVITY] — Monthly cost: $[X] | Time required: [X hours/week]
2. [ACTIVITY] — Monthly cost: $[X] | Time required: [X hours/week]
3. [ACTIVITY] — Monthly cost: $[X] | Time required: [X hours/week]
4. [ACTIVITY] — Monthly cost: $[X] | Time required: [X hours/week]
5. [ACTIVITY] — Monthly cost: $[X] | Time required: [X hours/week]

**Total monthly cost:** $[SUM]  
**Total time required:** [X hours/week]

## Part 4: Calculate Your Target Monthly Income (TMI)

Add up all monthly costs from Having and Doing, plus baseline living expenses.

### Baseline Living Expenses

- Housing: $[X]/month
- Food: $[X]/month
- Transportation: $[X]/month
- Insurance (health, life, etc.): $[X]/month
- Utilities & services: $[X]/month
- Savings & investments: $[X]/month
- Miscellaneous: $[X]/month

**Total baseline:** $[SUM]/month

### Ideal Lifestyle Additions

- Total from "Having": $[X]/month
- Total from "Doing": $[X]/month

**Total lifestyle additions:** $[SUM]/month

### Target Monthly Income (TMI)

**Baseline + Lifestyle = $[SUM]/month**

Multiply by 1.3 to account for taxes and buffer: **$[SUM × 1.3]/month**

**Annual Target Income: $[SUM × 12]**

## Part 5: Reality Check

### Your Current Income vs. Target Income

- Current monthly income: $[X]
- Target monthly income: $[X]
- Gap: $[X]

### Key Questions

1. **Is the gap smaller than you thought?**  
   Many people discover their ideal life costs less than expected. You might already be there, or close.

2. **Is the gap larger than you thought?**  
   If so, what's the path to close it? More revenue? Higher margins? A sale or exit?

3. **Which parts of your ideal life can you afford now?**  
   You don't have to wait for everything. What can you start doing today?

4. **What are you spending money on that's NOT in your ideal life?**  
   This is the most revealing question. Where is money leaking toward things you don't actually want?

## Part 6: The 6-Month Test Run

Pick 2-3 items from your "Doing" list and test them for six months.

Examples:
- "I'll take one week off per quarter for the next six months"
- "I'll train with a coach twice per week for six months"
- "I'll host a monthly dinner with close friends for six months"

After six months, assess:
- Did this improve my life?
- Is it worth the cost and time?
- Do I want to make it permanent?

Test before you commit.

## How To Use This Framework

1. **Complete it once per year** — Your ideal life will evolve. Update this annually.
2. **Use it to evaluate opportunities** — If a business opportunity would take you further from your ideal life, it's probably not worth it.
3. **Share it with your partner or close advisor** — This is a powerful conversation starter about what you're actually optimizing for.
4. **Reference it when making financial decisions** — Are you spending toward your ideal life, or away from it?

*Most people work hard toward a lifestyle they never defined. Define it first. Then build toward it.*
