# Vivid Vision Framework

*Inspired by Tony Robbins and Cameron Herold's approach to future-state visualization — a method for designing your ideal future in rich, sensory detail.*

---

## What This Is

A Vivid Vision is not a goal list. It's a **narrative description of your ideal future state**, written as if it's already happened.

The purpose is clarity. When you can see, feel, and articulate what you want in detail, decisions become easier. You know what moves you toward that vision and what doesn't.

**Time required:** 2-3 hours for the first draft. 30 minutes quarterly to revisit and refine.

---

## How This Works

You'll write descriptions of your ideal future state across three time horizons:
- **3 years from now** (specific enough to feel real)
- **10 years from now** (expansive enough to dream)
- **End of life** (reflective enough to clarify what truly matters)

For each horizon, you'll describe:
- **Your company or work** (if applicable)
- **Your lifestyle** (how you spend your time and energy)
- **Your relationships** (who you're with, how it feels)
- **Your identity** (who you've become)

Write in **present tense**. Write with **sensory detail**. Write as if it's already true.

## 3-Year Vivid Vision

*It's [THREE YEARS FROM NOW]. What's true?*

### Your Company / Work

What does [YOUR COMPANY] look like? How big is it? What's your role? Who's on the team? What are customers saying?

[e.g., "It's 2029. [YOUR COMPANY] is generating $50M in annual revenue with a team of 120. We're the clear market leader in [YOUR SPACE]. I'm no longer in operations — I have a COO, CFO, and CRO who run the business. My role is strategy, capital allocation, and key partnerships. We're profitable, growing 40% year-over-year, and we've had three inbound acquisition offers we chose not to take. The team is strong, the culture is healthy, and I'm not the bottleneck."]

Your turn:

---

### Your Lifestyle

How do you spend your days? What does your weekly rhythm look like? Where do you live? How much do you travel?

[e.g., "I work four focused days per week. Mondays are for strategy and leadership meetings. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are deep work — no calls, no Slack. Thursdays are for partnerships and external meetings. Fridays are off. I take one week off per quarter. I live in [PLACE], work from a home office with natural light, and travel to see the team once per month. I don't check email on weekends."]

Your turn:

---

### Your Relationships

Who are you spending time with? How do those relationships feel?

[e.g., "I have dinner with my family five nights a week. I see my closest friends once per month. I have a personal board of directors — three people I trust completely who challenge my thinking. I'm no longer the person everyone comes to for answers. My leadership team runs the company, and I'm a thought partner, not a firefighter."]

Your turn:

---

### Your Identity

Who have you become? How would you describe yourself?

[e.g., "I'm a CEO who built a company that works without me. I'm a strategic thinker, not a tactical executor. I'm someone who makes decisions quickly, delegates fully, and protects my energy. I'm known for clarity, not hustle."]

Your turn:

---

## 10-Year Vivid Vision

*It's [TEN YEARS FROM NOW]. What's true?*

### Your Company / Work

Is [YOUR COMPANY] still the focus? Did you sell? Scale? Start something new? What's your relationship to work?

[e.g., "It's 2036. I sold [YOUR COMPANY] in 2032 for $200M. I took a year off, then became an investor and advisor. I back 10-15 early-stage founders per year. I'm on two boards. I write, speak, and teach. Work feels like creative expression, not obligation."]

Your turn:

---

### Your Lifestyle

How do you spend your time? What does a typical week look like?

[e.g., "I live between [PLACE] and [PLACE]. I work 20 hours per week on things I choose. I spend mornings writing. I invest in companies I believe in. I travel internationally 3-4 times per year. I'm in the best shape of my life. I have space to think, create, and be present."]

Your turn:

---

### Your Relationships

Who are the most important people in your life? What do those relationships look like?

[e.g., "My marriage is the strongest it's ever been. My kids are [AGE] and [AGE] — I've been present for their key milestones. I have a tight group of 5-6 friends I see regularly. I mentor younger founders and genuinely enjoy it."]

Your turn:

---

### Your Identity

Who have you become?

[e.g., "I'm someone who built, scaled, and exited a business without burning out. I'm a patient investor, a clear thinker, and a generous mentor. I'm known for building things that last."]

Your turn:

---

## End of Life Vision

*It's the end of your life. You're reflecting back. What mattered most?*

This isn't morbid. It's clarifying.

Write 5-10 sentences describing what you hope to feel, remember, and be proud of.

[e.g., "I built a business that created value and treated people well. I was present for my family. I helped other founders avoid mistakes I made. I wrote things that mattered. I didn't waste time on bullshit. I took risks and stood by my values. I lived intentionally."]

Your turn:

## How To Use This Framework

1. Write your first draft in one sitting (2-3 hours)
2. Save it and come back a week later — does it still feel true?
3. Revisit quarterly: Is your current path aligned with this vision? If not, what needs to change?
4. Update as your vision evolves — this is not static

**Key question:** If you keep doing what you're doing now, will you arrive at this vision? If not, what needs to change?

*A vision without decisions is a daydream. Use this to guide choices.*
