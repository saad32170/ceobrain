## How To Use Uploaded Documents

### Step 1: Drop Files Here

- Put past annual reviews in `past_annual_reviews/`
- Put notes, journals, or other documents in `notes/`

You can organize these however makes sense to you. Use subfolders if helpful.

---

### Step 2: Read and Summarize

Read through your uploaded documents and ask:

1. **What goals have you set repeatedly but never achieved?**
2. **What patterns show up across multiple years?**
3. **What feedback do you get consistently?**
4. **Where have you grown? Where have you stayed stuck?**
5. **What blind spots keep appearing?**
6. **What strengths do you undervalue?**

---

### Step 3: Extract Patterns

Add key insights to `memory.md` under the section **"Themes From Uploaded Documents."**

Example:

```
### From Past Annual Reviews
- 2022-2024 all mention needing better ops support. Still haven't hired for it.
- 2023 and 2024 both highlight burnout in Q4. Need to plan better for year-end.

### From Performance Reviews
- Consistent feedback: strong vision, weak delegation
- Team says I'm accessible but inconsistent in follow-through
```

---

### Step 4: Reference in Future Reviews

When you do quarterly and annual reviews, reference these patterns:
- Are you repeating the same goals without progress?
- Are you making the same mistakes?
- Are old blind spots still blind spots?
- Have you addressed recurring feedback?

## What To Do With This Information

**If you notice repeated goals:**  
Either commit fully and make a plan, or stop writing them down. Repeated goals you never act on are just guilt, not guidance.

**If you notice repeated feedback:**  
This is probably true. Stop dismissing it. What needs to change?

**If you notice recurring failures:**  
Look at the conditions. Is it bad execution, bad goal-setting, or misalignment with what you actually want?

**If you notice repeated strengths:**  
Double down. Your strengths are your leverage.

## Privacy Note

No one else will see these files unless you share them. Be honest.

The goal is self-awareness, not self-judgment.
