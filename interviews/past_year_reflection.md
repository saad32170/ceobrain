# Past Year Reflection Interview

*A guided conversation with yourself about the year that just passed.*

---

## What This Is

This is a reflective interview designed to help you process the past year honestly and deeply.

It's not a performance review. It's not about metrics or milestones. It's about **understanding what happened, how you felt, and what you learned.**

**Time required:** 60-90 minutes, ideally uninterrupted.

**When to use this:** Once per year, during your annual review process — or anytime you're feeling stuck and need perspective.

---

## Instructions

Read each question slowly. Write your answers without editing or filtering. No one else will read this unless you choose to share it.

If a question doesn't land, skip it. If a question unlocks something important, spend more time there.

## Part 1: The Year in Review

### Tell me about the last year — highlights first.

*What were the moments, decisions, or achievements you're most proud of?*

Take your time. List at least 5-10 things. Be specific.

---

### Now the lowlights. What were the hardest moments?

*What didn't go the way you hoped? What disappointed you?*

Be honest. This is where the learning is.

---

### What surprised you this year?

*Good surprises and bad. What did you not see coming?*

---

### If you could replay this year, what would you do differently?

*Not with perfect information — just with what you know now about yourself.*

---

### What did you avoid this year?

*What hard decisions did you defer? What conversations did you not have?*

---

## Part 2: Energy and Time

### What drained you the most this year?

*What consistently pulled energy without giving much back?*

Think about:
- Specific people or relationships
- Types of work or decisions
- Recurring situations

---

### What energized you the most?

*When did you feel most alive, clear, or in flow?*

---

### Where did your time actually go?

*If you had to estimate how you spent your waking hours this year, what would the breakdown look like?*

Example:
- 40% on [X]
- 25% on [Y]
- 15% on [Z]
- 10% on [A]
- 10% on [B]

Now ask: **Is that where you wanted it to go?**

---

### What would you have spent more time on, if you could?

---

### What would you have spent less time on?

---

## Part 3: Relationships and Team

### Who were the most important people in your life this year?

---

### Who did you lose touch with that you wish you hadn't?

---

### What relationships improved this year?

*What changed? What did you do differently?*

---

### What relationships got worse or more strained?

*Why? What was your role in that?*

---

### If you were managing yourself this year, what feedback would you give?

*Be specific. What did you do well? What do you need to work on?*

---

## Part 4: Decisions and Values

### What are you most proud of that no one else sees?

*The quiet decisions, the restraint, the integrity when no one was watching.*

---

### Where did you compromise your values?

*When did you say yes when you meant no? When did you optimize for short-term gain over long-term alignment?*

---

### What did you say no to that you're grateful for now?

---

### What did you say yes to that you regret?

---

### Where did you show up as your best self?

---

### Where did you show up as a version of yourself you didn't like?

*No judgment. Just notice.*

---

### What assumptions did you have at the start of the year that turned out to be wrong?

### What skill or capacity did you develop this year?

---

### What skill or capacity do you wish you'd developed?

---

## Part 6: The Regret Minimization Test

### If this year repeated ten times, would you be satisfied?

*This is Jeff Bezos's "Regret Minimization Framework" applied to the year that just passed.*

If you had to live this exact year ten more times — same choices, same rhythms, same priorities — would that be a life well-lived?

If yes, why?

If no, what needs to change?

---

### When you're 80 years old, looking back, what will you be glad you did this year?

---

### What will you regret not doing?

---

## Part 7: Letting Go

### What are you ready to let go of?

*This could be beliefs, habits, goals, relationships, or ways of working that no longer serve you.*

Examples:
- "The belief that I have to be the hardest worker in the room"

- "The goal of being seen as indispensable"

List at least 3 things you're consciously leaving behind:

1.

*What's worth keeping? What's working?*

### In one sentence, how would you describe this year?

[e.g., "A year of building fast, learning hard, and realizing I need to delegate more."]
