# Identity and Values Interview

*A guided conversation to clarify who you are and what you stand for.*

---

## What This Is

This is a deep reflection on identity and values — not who you think you should be, but **who you actually are** and **what actually matters to you.**

It's designed to surface:
- Your core values (the principles that guide your decisions)
- Your identity (how you see yourself and want to be seen)
- Your non-negotiables (what you won't compromise on)
- Your strengths and blind spots

**Time required:** 60-90 minutes.

**When to use this:** Once per year, or anytime you feel misaligned, unclear, or like you're drifting.

---

## Instructions

These questions are designed to go deep. Write honestly. Don't perform. No one is grading this.

If a question feels too big, start small. You can always come back and add more.

---

## Part 1: Core Values

### What are the 3-5 values that guide your life?

### How do you want to be remembered?
