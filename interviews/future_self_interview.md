# Future Self Interview

*A conversation with the version of you 3, 5, or 10 years from now.*

---

## What This Is

This is a thought experiment designed to give you perspective, clarity, and direction.

You'll imagine yourself 3, 5, or 10 years in the future — having lived well, made good decisions, and stayed aligned with your values — and interview that version of yourself.

**Why this works:**  
Your future self has already solved the problems you're facing now. They know what mattered and what didn't. They have perspective you don't have yet.

This exercise helps you access that perspective **now**, so you can make better decisions today.

**Time required:** 45-60 minutes.

**When to use this:** Once per year, or anytime you're at a major decision point or crossroads.

## Instructions

Pick a time horizon: 3 years, 5 years, or 10 years from now.

Close your eyes for a moment and imagine that future version of yourself clearly:
- Where are they?
- What do they look like?
- How do they carry themselves?
- What's their energy like?

Now, interview them.
