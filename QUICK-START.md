# Quick Start Guide

## Welcome to Your Personal Operating System

You've just received a complete personal productivity system designed specifically for CEOs, founders, and operators.

This is not software. This is a **system** — a set of practices, frameworks, and prompts that help you think clearly, decide intentionally, and stay aligned with what matters.

---

## What To Do Right Now (First 15 Minutes)

### 1. Read `README.md` (5 minutes)

Open `README.md` and skim it to understand what this system is and how it works.

**File location:** `ceo-personal-os/README.md`

---

### 2. Read `principles.md` (5 minutes)

Open `principles.md` to understand the philosophy behind this system.

**File location:** `ceo-personal-os/principles.md`

This matters. If you don't understand why the system exists, you won't use it.

---

### 3. Complete `north_star.md` (5 minutes)

Open `north_star.md` and fill out:
- Your current 3-5 priorities
- What you're optimizing for (and minimizing)
- Your non-negotiables

**File location:** `ceo-personal-os/north_star.md`

This is your baseline. Everything else flows from here.

---

## What To Do Today (Your First Daily Check-In)

### Run Your First Daily Check-In (5 minutes)

1. Create a new file in `reviews/daily/` and name it with today's date (e.g., `2026-01-15.md`)
2. Copy the template from `reviews/daily/TEMPLATE-daily-checkin.md`
3. Fill it out honestly

**What you'll answer:**
- Energy level (1-10)
- One meaningful win
- One friction point
- One thing to let go of
- One priority for tomorrow

That's it. Close the file and move on.

---

## What To Do This Week

### Run Your First Weekly Review (20 minutes)

On Sunday evening or Monday morning:

1. Create a new file in `reviews/weekly/` and name it with the week (e.g., `2026-W03.md`)
2. Copy the template from `reviews/weekly/TEMPLATE-weekly-review.md`
3. Fill it out

**What you'll reflect on:**
- What moved the needle this week?
- What was noise?
- Where did time leak?
- One strategic insight
- One adjustment for next week

---

## What To Do This Month

### Optional: Complete One Interview (60-90 minutes)

If you want to go deeper, pick one of the interviews in the `interviews/` folder and work through it:

**Recommended order:**
1. **`past_year_reflection.md`** — Reflect on the past year (great if you're starting in January)
2. **`identity_and_values.md`** — Get clear on who you are and what you stand for
3. **`future_self_interview.md`** — Have a conversation with your future self

You don't have to do all three at once. Pick one that feels most relevant right now.

---

## What To Do This Quarter

### Complete a Quarterly Review (2-3 hours)

At the end of Q1 (late March):

1. Create a new file in `reviews/quarterly/` (e.g., `2026-Q1.md`)
2. Copy the template from `reviews/quarterly/TEMPLATE-quarterly-review.md`
3. Block 2-3 hours and work through it

**This is where you:**
- Review your quarterly goals
- Analyze energy vs. output
- Detect misalignment
- Make course corrections

---

## What To Do This Year

### Complete an Annual Review (4-6 hours)

At the end of the year (late December or early January):

1. Create a new file in `reviews/annual/` (e.g., `2026-annual-review.md`)
2. Copy the template from `reviews/annual/TEMPLATE-annual-review.md`
3. Block a full day (or two half-days) and work through it

**This is your deepest reflection:**
- Gustin-style annual review
- Life Map evaluation (all 6 domains)
- Update Vivid Vision and Ideal Life Costing
- Set clear intent for the next year

---

## Optional: Explore the Frameworks

You don't need to complete all the frameworks immediately. They're tools you use when you need them.

**Framework files (in `frameworks/` folder):**
- **`annual_review.md`** — Gustin-style annual reflection (use once per year)
- **`vivid_vision.md`** — Design your ideal future in 3, 10 years, and end-of-life (use once, revisit annually)
- **`ideal_life_costing.md`** — Calculate what your ideal lifestyle actually costs (use once, update annually)
- **`life_map.md`** — Evaluate all 6 life domains (career, relationships, health, meaning, finances, fun) (use annually)

Skim them now. Use them when you're ready.

---

## Optional: Upload Past Documents

If you have past annual reviews, performance reviews, or personal notes:

1. Drop them in `uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `uploads/notes/`
2. Read through them and look for patterns
3. Add key insights to `memory.md`

**What to look for:**
- Goals you've set repeatedly but never achieved
- Feedback you've received consistently
- Patterns that show up across multiple years
- Strengths you undervalue
- Blind spots you ignore

---

## The Rhythm (Summary)

Once you're set up, your rhythm is:

- **Daily (5 minutes):** Quick check-in every evening or morning
- **Weekly (20 minutes):** Reflection every Sunday evening or Monday morning
- **Quarterly (2-3 hours):** Deep review at the end of each quarter
- **Annually (1 day):** Comprehensive reflection and planning

That's it. You're not tracking everything. You're noticing patterns, making adjustments, and staying aligned.

---

## What If You Don't Stick With It?

Most people don't.

Here's why this time could be different:

1. **Start small.** Just do daily check-ins for 30 days. That's it. Prove to yourself it's useful.
2. **Protect the time.** Calendar the weekly review. Make it non-negotiable.
3. **Notice the benefit.** This only works if you actually see the value. If you're not getting clarity, adjust the system or stop doing it.

The goal is not compliance. It's clarity.

If the system doesn't create clarity, it's not working. Change it or kill it.

---

## Need Help?

**If you're confused:**  
Re-read `README.md` and `principles.md`. The philosophy matters.

**If you're overwhelmed:**  
Just do the daily check-ins for 30 days. Ignore everything else. Build the habit first.

**If you're not sure it's working:**  
Give it 90 days. Run daily check-ins, weekly reviews, and one quarterly review. Then decide.

---

## Your Next Action

Close this file.

Open `north_star.md` and fill it out.

Then run your first daily check-in.

That's all you need to do today.

---

*This system is yours. Adjust it. Use what works. Ignore what doesn't. The point is clarity, not compliance.*
