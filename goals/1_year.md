# 1-Year Goals

**Year:** [YEAR]  
**Last Updated:** [DATE]

## What This Is

These are your goals for the next 12 months — the specific, measurable outcomes you're working toward.

This is not a wish list. These are commitments.

**Guidelines:**
- **Be specific.** Vague goals don't get done.
- **Make them measurable.** You should be able to clearly say "yes, I did this" or "no, I didn't."
- **Focus on outcomes, not activities.** "Hire a COO" is a goal. "Have 10 recruiter calls" is a task.
- **Limit to 5-7 major goals.** More than that and you're not focused.

## Role and Identity Goals

*How do you want your role to evolve this year?*

### Current Role

Right now, I am: [e.g., "The lead salesperson, strategist, and bottleneck for most decisions"]

### Target Role (End of Year)

By the end of this year, I want to be: [e.g., "The strategist and capital allocator. I want to be out of sales and operations entirely."]

### What needs to change for this transition to happen?

- [e.g., "Hire a VP of Sales who can close enterprise deals"]
- [e.g., "Hire a COO who can run day-to-day operations"]
- [e.g., "Train the leadership team to make decisions without me"]

---

## Key Decisions to Make This Year

*What major decisions do you need to make, even if you don't have all the answers yet?*

1. [e.g., "Decide whether to fundraise or stay bootstrapped"]
2. [e.g., "Decide whether to double down on current product or expand into new market"]
3. [e.g., "Decide whether to keep co-founder or part ways"]

---

## What You're Saying No To This Year

*Clarifying what you're NOT doing is as important as clarifying what you are doing.*

- [e.g., "Not launching new products this year — focus on core"]
- [e.g., "Not taking speaking engagements unless they directly drive revenue"]
- [e.g., "Not fundraising until we hit $20M ARR"]

---

## Success Criteria

**At the end of this year, I will consider it a successful year if:**

1. [e.g., "We hit $15M ARR and I'm no longer the bottleneck"]
2. [e.g., "I took 4 weeks fully offline and felt genuinely rested"]
3. [e.g., "I made a clear decision on whether to scale or sell"]

## How To Use This Document

- **Review monthly** — Are you still on track? Do priorities need to shift?
- **Update quarterly** — Use your quarterly reviews to assess progress and make adjustments
- **Reference when deciding** — If an opportunity doesn't support these goals, it's probably a distraction
- **Be honest** — If a goal stops mattering, remove it. Don't carry dead goals out of obligation.

*Goals are not a contract. They're a compass. Adjust as needed, but know why you're adjusting.*
