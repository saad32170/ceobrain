## What This Is

This is your 3-year vision — specific enough to feel real, expansive enough to require growth.

Three years is far enough away to imagine meaningful change, but close enough to take action toward it today.

This document answers:
- **Where do you want to be in 3 years?**
- **What do you want to have built?**
- **Who do you want to have become?**

## Professional Vision (3 Years)

### The Company

**What does [YOUR COMPANY] look like 3 years from now?**

Think about:
- Revenue and profitability
- Team size and structure
- Market position
- Product or service maturity
- Your role and involvement

[e.g., "It's 2029. [YOUR COMPANY] is generating $50M in annual revenue with 120 employees. We're the clear market leader in [YOUR SPACE]. I'm no longer in operations — I have a COO, CFO, and CRO who run the business. My role is strategy, capital allocation, and key partnerships. We're profitable, growing 40% YoY, and we've turned down multiple acquisition offers because we're building for the long term."]

Your vision:

---

### Your Role

**What is your role in 3 years, and how is it different from today?**

[e.g., "I've transitioned from operator to strategist. I spend 50% of my time thinking 3-5 years ahead, 30% on partnerships and capital allocation, and 20% on leadership development. I'm no longer the bottleneck. The business runs without me."]

Your role:

---

### Career Optionality

**What options do you want to have in 3 years?**

[e.g., "I want to have the option to sell the company for $100M+, scale it to $100M ARR, or step back and run it part-time with a strong leadership team. The point is optionality — I'm not locked into one path."]

Your optionality:

---

## Personal Vision (3 Years)

### Lifestyle

**How do you spend your time? What does your weekly rhythm look like?**

[e.g., "I work 4 days per week, with Fridays off. I take one week off per quarter. I live in [PLACE], work from a home office, and travel once per month. I have space to think, write, and create. I don't check email on weekends."]

Your lifestyle:

---

### Relationships

**What do your key relationships look like in 3 years?**

[e.g., "My marriage is the strongest it's ever been. My kids are [AGE] and [AGE] — I've been present for their key milestones. I have 5-6 close friends I see regularly. I have a personal board of directors who challenge and support me."]

Your relationships:

---

### Health and Energy

**What does your health look and feel like?**

[e.g., "I'm in the best shape of my life. I train 4x per week. I sleep 7-8 hours consistently. I have energy throughout the day. I don't rely on caffeine to function. I feel strong, clear, and resilient."]

Your health:

---

### Financial Security

**What does your financial situation look like?**

[e.g., "I have 24 months of personal runway. I'm paying myself $300K/year in salary. My equity stake is worth $10M+. I have a clear path to $20M+ in net worth within 5 years. I'm not stressed about money."]

Your finances:

## Identity and Growth (3 Years)

### Who You've Become

**Who are you in 3 years? How have you grown?**

[e.g., "I'm a CEO who built a company that scales without me. I'm a patient capital allocator, a clear thinker, and a generous mentor. I'm known for building sustainably, not just fast. I've learned to delegate fully and trust my team."]

Who you've become:

---

### Skills and Capacities

**What new skills or capacities have you developed?**

[e.g., "I've become a strong systems thinker. I can see patterns and design processes that scale. I'm a better communicator — both internally with my team and externally with partners and investors. I've learned to manage my energy, not just my time."]

## How To Use This Document

- **Revisit annually** — Is this vision still true? Update as needed.
- **Reference quarterly** — Are your short-term decisions aligned with this long-term vision?
- **Use it to evaluate opportunities** — If an opportunity doesn't move you toward this vision, it's probably a distraction.
- **Share with your team (selectively)** — If your leadership team knows where you're headed, they can help you get there.
