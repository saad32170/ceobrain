**Time Horizon:** [START YEAR] to [END YEAR]  
**Last Updated:** [DATE]

## What This Is

This is your 10-year horizon — expansive, aspirational, and intentionally broad.

Ten years is long enough to imagine profound change:
- You could build, scale, and exit a company
- You could shift industries or careers
- You could redefine your relationship with work entirely

This document is not a detailed plan. It's a **direction** and a **possibility space**.

## Possible Paths

*Ten years is long enough that multiple paths are possible. Sketch out 2-3 scenarios that feel compelling.*

### Path 1: [NAME THIS PATH]

**What happens:**  
[e.g., "I scale [YOUR COMPANY] to $100M+ ARR, take it public or sell it for $200M+, and transition into angel investing and advising founders."]

**What this requires:**  
[e.g., "Aggressive growth, likely fundraising, building a world-class leadership team, staying deeply involved for 7-8 years."]

**How this feels:**  
[e.g., "High intensity, high reward, meaningful exit. I'd be proud of building something that scales, but I'd also be ready to move on."]

---

### Path 2: [NAME THIS PATH]

**What happens:**  
[e.g., "I build [YOUR COMPANY] into a $50M ARR profitable, sustainable business that runs without me, and I work 10-20 hours per week while exploring other creative projects."]

**What this requires:**  
[e.g., "Hiring exceptional operators, resisting growth-for-growth's-sake, building systems and culture that scale without me."]

**How this feels:**  
[e.g., "Lower intensity, more freedom, more space for creativity. I'd have optionality and autonomy without burning out."]

---

### Path 3: [NAME THIS PATH]

**What happens:**  
[e.g., "I sell [YOUR COMPANY] in the next 3-5 years, take a year off, then start a new company in a different space with everything I've learned."]

**What this requires:**  
[e.g., "Getting [YOUR COMPANY] to a state where it's attractive to buyers, making the hard decision to let go, taking real time to reset."]

**How this feels:**  
[e.g., "A clean chapter break. A chance to apply what I know without carrying legacy baggage. High risk, high learning."]

### What do you want to have let go of in 10 years?

## Financial Goals (10-Year View)

### What's your 10-year financial target?

*Be specific. What's your target net worth? Annual income? Financial freedom number?*

[e.g., "Net worth of $20M+. Passive income of $500K+/year. Financially independent with full optionality."]

Your target:

---

### What does that number unlock for you?

*What would that level of financial security allow you to do?*

[e.g., "Work only on things I choose. Support causes I care about. Never feel financial stress again. Focus on impact over income."]

What it unlocks:

---

## End-of-Life Perspective

*This is not morbid — it's clarifying.*

### Imagine it's the end of your life. You're reflecting back on the next 10 years. What do you hope you did?

[e.g., "I built something meaningful. I was present for my family. I mentored others. I took risks and stood by my values. I didn't waste time on bullshit."]

Your reflection:

---

### What do you hope you didn't do?

[e.g., "I hope I didn't work so hard I missed my kids growing up. I hope I didn't optimize for status over fulfillment. I hope I didn't play it safe out of fear."]

Your reflection:

## Key Questions to Revisit Annually

*These questions don't need answers now. But they're worth revisiting every year.*

1. **Am I on a path toward the 10-year vision I want, or am I drifting?**
2. **What am I doing today that my 10-year-future self will be grateful for?**
3. **What am I doing today that my 10-year-future self will regret?**
4. **If I keep doing what I'm doing, where will I be in 10 years? Is that where I want to be?**
5. **What would have to change for my preferred path to become reality?**

## How To Use This Document

1. **Write it once, revisit it annually** — Your 10-year vision will evolve. That's expected.
2. **Use it to guide 3-year and 1-year planning** — Your 10-year horizon should inform shorter-term goals.
3. **Reference it during major decisions** — When you're at a crossroads, ask: "Which path moves me toward the 10-year future I want?"
4. **Don't treat it as a contract** — This is a compass, not a commitment. Adjust as you learn and grow.

*Ten years from now, you'll arrive somewhere. The question is: will it be by design or by default?*
