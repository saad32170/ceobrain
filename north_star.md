# North Star

## What This Is

Your North Star is the clearest, simplest articulation of what matters most to you **right now**.

Not forever. Not aspirationally. Right now.

This document should be short, honest, and specific enough to guide decisions.

When you're deciding whether to say yes to an opportunity, take a meeting, make a hire, or shift strategy — this document should help you decide.

## Your Current Priorities

*Fill this out honestly. 3-5 priorities maximum. If everything is a priority, nothing is.*

1. [PRIORITY 1 — e.g., "Get to $10M ARR by end of year"]
2. [PRIORITY 2 — e.g., "Hire a Head of Sales I trust completely"]
3. [PRIORITY 3 — e.g., "Protect evening time with family"]
4. [PRIORITY 4 — optional]
5. [PRIORITY 5 — optional]

## What You're Optimizing For

*In this season of life, what are you trying to maximize? What are you trying to minimize?*

**Maximizing:**
- [e.g., "Revenue growth"]
- [e.g., "Team autonomy"]
- [e.g., "Energy and clarity"]

**Minimizing:**
- [e.g., "Low-leverage meetings"]
- [e.g., "Reactive fire-fighting"]
- [e.g., "Time spent on things others can do"]

## What You're Not Doing Right Now

*Clarifying what you're NOT doing is as important as clarifying what you are doing.*

This is not a "someday" list. This is an active "not now" list.

- [e.g., "Not fundraising this year"]
- [e.g., "Not launching new products until we nail our core offering"]
- [e.g., "Not taking speaking engagements unless they directly lead to revenue"]

## Your Current Role Identity

*How do you see your role right now? This will evolve over time.*

Right now, I am: [e.g., "the chief salesperson and strategist — my job is to close enterprise deals and set direction. I'm transitioning OUT of product and operations."]

In six months, I want to be: [e.g., "the strategist and capital allocator — my job is to think two years ahead and deploy resources. I want to be OUT of sales and execution."]

## Your Non-Negotiables

*What will you not compromise on, even under pressure?*

- [e.g., "I don't work weekends unless it's an emergency"]
- [e.g., "I don't stay in partnerships that erode trust"]
- [e.g., "I don't sacrifice long-term alignment for short-term growth"]

## Your One-Sentence North Star

*If you could only communicate one thing about what you're doing and why, what would it be?*

[e.g., "I'm building a company that generates $50M in revenue without burning me out, so I can scale it sustainably or sell it on my terms."]
