## Key Features

### 1. Complete Templates

Every template is fully written with:
- Clear instructions
- Thoughtful prompts
- Examples where helpful
- Guidance on how to use the output

You never have to wonder "what do I write here?"

### 2. Frameworks Properly Credited

All frameworks credit their originators:
- **Annual Review:** Dr. Anthony Gustin
- **Vivid Vision:** Tony Robbins / Cameron Herold
- **Ideal Life Costing:** Tim Ferriss
- **Life Map:** Alex Lieberman

Each framework is adapted and explained in CEO-friendly language.

### 3. Executive Tone

- No hustle culture
- No therapy speak
- No corporate jargon
- No productivity porn

Just calm, clear, insightful prompts designed for someone who's already accomplished and doesn't need motivation — just clarity.

### 4. Editable and Adaptable

Everything uses placeholders like:
- `[YOUR COMPANY]`
- `[YOUR ROLE]`
- `[YOUR STAGE OF LIFE]`
- `[YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES]`

Personalize once, or just edit as you go.

### 5. Memory System

`memory.md` is your accumulated self-knowledge:
- Recurring patterns
- Repeated goals
- Strengths and blind spots
- Key insights from past reviews
- Themes from uploaded documents

This is what makes the system compound over time.

### 6. Upload and Pattern Detection

Drop past annual reviews, performance reviews, or notes into `uploads/`, extract patterns, and add them to `memory.md`. Your past becomes data that informs your future.

## How Long Does This Take?

| Activity | Frequency | Time |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Daily check-in | Daily | 5 minutes |
| Weekly review | Weekly | 20 minutes |
| Quarterly review | Quarterly | 2-3 hours |
| Annual review | Annually | 4-6 hours (1 full day) |
| **Total annual time investment** | | **~40-50 hours per year** |

That's about 1% of your waking hours. The ROI is clarity, alignment, and fewer wasted months.

---

## What Makes This Different

Most productivity systems add complexity. This one removes it.

**You don't need:**
- Apps or software
- Dashboards or analytics
- Gamification or streaks
- External accountability

**You do need:**
- 5 minutes per day
- 20 minutes per week
- 2 hours per quarter
- 1 day per year

If you protect that time, this system will compound.

---

## Assumptions Documented

This system assumes:
- You're a CEO, founder, or senior operator
- You value clarity over dashboards
- You prefer plain text over apps
- You trust yourself and don't need gamification
- You're comfortable editing markdown files (or treating them like text files)
- You can commit to the time investment above

If any of these don't fit, adjust the system. It's yours.
