# Weekly Review — Week 1, 2026

*Example weekly review to show you what this looks like in practice*

**Week of:** December 30, 2025 to January 5, 2026

---

## What Moved the Needle This Week?

- Built the CEO Personal Operating System — complete structure, frameworks, and templates
- Set clear intent to use this system consistently in 2026
- Spent time thinking about priorities instead of just reacting

---

## What Was Noise?

- Too much time browsing productivity tools and systems before just building this one
- Overthinking the "perfect" way to structure this — done is better than perfect

---

## Where Did Time Leak?

- Lost a few hours to distraction and tab-switching while building this
- Didn't protect focus time as well as I could have

---

## One Strategic Insight

Having a system doesn't create clarity — using the system does. The templates are done. Now it's about showing up consistently.

---

## One Adjustment for Next Week

Run my first real daily check-in every evening this week. No skipping.

---

## Energy Check

**Overall energy this week:** 8/10

**What energized me:**  
Building something useful from scratch. Clear structure feels good.

**What drained me:**  
Knowing I've built systems before and haven't stuck with them. This time needs to be different.

---

## Alignment Check

**Partially aligned.**

I've built the infrastructure, but I haven't actually used it yet. Next week is the real test.

---

## One Question to Carry Forward

Can I actually commit to 5 minutes per day for a month straight? What happens if I do?

---

*Week 1 is setup. Week 2 is execution. Let's go.*
