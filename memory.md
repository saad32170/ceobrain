# Memory: Patterns, Insights, and Themes Over Time

## What This Is

This is your system's memory — a running log of patterns, insights, and themes that emerge from your reviews, interviews, and reflections.

Over time, you'll notice things:
- Goals you set repeatedly but never achieve
- Strengths you undervalue
- Blind spots you ignore
- Situations that consistently drain you
- Decisions you keep deferring

Write them here. Reference them in future reviews.

This document is your **accumulated self-knowledge**.

## Recurring Patterns

*Things you notice happening again and again.*

### Strengths You Consistently Undervalue

- [e.g., "I'm good at spotting talent, but I don't trust my instincts fast enough"]
- [e.g., "I simplify complex problems well, but I assume everyone else can too"]

### Repeated Goals (Not Yet Achieved)

- [e.g., "Hire a COO — written in last 3 annual reviews, still haven't done it"]
- [e.g., "Delegate ops — keep saying I will, keep pulling it back"]

### Recurring Drains

- [e.g., "Customer support escalations — takes 10+ hours/week, kills momentum"]
- [e.g., "Board prep — feels performative, not strategic"]

### Situations That Energize You

- [e.g., "Closing deals with enterprise customers"]
- [e.g., "Whiteboard strategy sessions with senior team"]
- [e.g., "Writing — clarifies my thinking"]

### Situations That Deplete You

- [e.g., "Internal conflict between team members"]
- [e.g., "Fundraising conversations when I'm not ready"]
- [e.g., "Being the default decision-maker on everything"]

## Key Insights From Past Reviews

*Insights that landed and changed something.*

**[DATE] — [SHORT INSIGHT]**
- [e.g., "2025-Q4: Realized I'm optimizing for growth at the expense of quality. Decided to slow hiring and tighten product."]

**[DATE] — [SHORT INSIGHT]**
- [e.g., "2025-Q2: Noticed I avoid hard conversations until they become crises. Committed to weekly 1-on-1s with direct reports."]

**[DATE] — [SHORT INSIGHT]**
- [e.g., "2024 Annual Review: Saw that my best decisions came from deep work blocks, not meetings. Protected Tuesdays for no-meeting strategy days."]

## Themes From Uploaded Documents

*If you've uploaded past annual reviews, performance reviews, or personal notes, summarize patterns here.*

### From Past Annual Reviews

- [e.g., "2022-2024 all mention needing better ops support. Still haven't hired for it."]
- [e.g., "2023 and 2024 reviews both highlight burnout in Q4. Need to plan better for year-end."]

### From Performance Reviews

- [e.g., "Consistent feedback: strong vision, weak delegation"]
- [e.g., "Team says I'm accessible but inconsistent in follow-through"]

### From Personal Notes

- [e.g., "Wrote about needing 'whitespace' in 2023, 2024, and 2025 planning docs. Still not protecting it."]

---

## Blind Spots

*Things you suspect but don't fully see.*

- [e.g., "I might be holding onto control in areas where others could execute better"]
- [e.g., "I avoid financial planning because I don't want to face the numbers"]
- [e.g., "I say 'team empowerment' but I override decisions when I'm anxious"]

---

## Decisions You Keep Deferring

*What are you avoiding?*

- [e.g., "Deciding whether to scale or sell"]
- [e.g., "Letting go of a co-founder who's no longer contributing"]
- [e.g., "Committing to a niche instead of staying broad"]

## How To Use This Document

- **Add to it during reviews.** When you notice a pattern, write it here.
- **Reference it in quarterly and annual reviews.** Are old patterns still true? Have you addressed recurring issues?
- **Share selectively.** If you work with a coach, advisor, or trusted peer, this document is gold. It's your self-awareness distilled.

*This document should grow over time. If it's empty a year from now, you're not reflecting deeply enough.*
