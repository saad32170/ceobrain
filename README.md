# CEO Personal Operating System

## What This Is

This is your personal productivity system. Not software. Not an app. A **system** — a set of practices, prompts, and frameworks that help you think clearly, decide intentionally, and live deliberately.

It's designed for you: a CEO, founder, or operator who needs clarity without bureaucracy, accountability without surveillance, and reflection without therapy speak.

This system helps you:
- Run daily check-ins in under 5 minutes
- Conduct weekly reviews that separate signal from noise
- Evaluate quarterly progress and course-correct
- Reflect annually with depth and honesty
- Design your ideal future state
- Track patterns in your thinking and behavior over time

## How To Use This System

### First-Time Setup (15 minutes)

1. **Read `principles.md`** — Understand the philosophy behind this system
2. **Complete `north_star.md`** — Define what matters most to you right now
3. **Skim the frameworks folder** — You don't need to complete these yet, just know they exist
4. **Optional: Upload past documents** — Drop old annual reviews, performance reviews, or personal notes into `uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `uploads/notes/`. Read through them yourself and note patterns in `memory.md`

That's it. You're ready.

### Daily Rhythm (5 minutes)

Every evening or morning, create a new file in `reviews/daily/` named with today's date (e.g., `2026-01-15.md`).

Copy the template from any existing daily file, or use this structure:
- Energy level (1-10)
- One meaningful win
- One friction point
- One thing to let go of
- One priority for tomorrow

Write briefly. Bullet points are fine. This is a pulse check, not a performance review.

### Weekly Rhythm (20 minutes)

Every Sunday evening or Monday morning, create a new file in `reviews/weekly/` named with the week (e.g., `2026-W03.md`).

Ask yourself:
- What moved the needle this week?
- What was noise?
- Where did time leak?
- One strategic insight
- One adjustment for next week

### Quarterly Rhythm (2 hours)

At the end of each quarter, create a file in `reviews/quarterly/` (e.g., `2026-Q1.md`).

Use this time to:
- Review your quarterly goals
- Detect misalignment between stated priorities and actual behavior
- Analyze energy versus output
- Make one or two meaningful course corrections

### Annual Rhythm (1 day)

Once per year, ideally in late December or early January, create a file in `reviews/annual/` (e.g., `2025-review.md`).

This is your deepest reflection:
- Complete the Gustin-style Annual Review (`frameworks/annual_review.md`)
- Update your Life Map (`frameworks/life_map.md`)
- Revisit Ideal Lifestyle Costing (`frameworks/ideal_life_costing.md`)
- Refresh your Vivid Vision (`frameworks/vivid_vision.md`)
- Write a narrative of the past year and set intent for the next

This isn't bureaucratic. It's clarifying.

## How To Personalize This System

Every file contains placeholders like `[YOUR COMPANY]`, `[YOUR ROLE]`, or `[YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES]`. 

When you first use a file, do a quick search-and-replace, or just edit as you go. This system adapts to you.

### Common Personalizations

- **Your company name**: Replace `[YOUR COMPANY]` throughout
- **Your role**: Replace `[YOUR ROLE]` (e.g., CEO, Founder, COO)
- **Your stage**: Replace `[YOUR STAGE OF LIFE]` (e.g., "building to exit," "scaling sustainably," "exploring what's next")
- **Your priorities**: Replace `[YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES]` with your actual focus areas

## Assumptions Documented

This system assumes:
- You are a CEO, founder, or senior operator
- You value clarity over dashboards
- You prefer plain text over apps
- You trust yourself and don't need gamification
- You want accountability, not surveillance
- You can spend 5 minutes daily, 20 minutes weekly, 2 hours quarterly, and 1 day annually on reflection
- You're comfortable editing markdown files (or treating them like Word docs)

If any of these assumptions don't fit, adjust the system. It's yours.

## Why This Works

Most productivity systems add complexity. This one removes it.

You don't need to track everything. You need to notice patterns, make adjustments, and stay aligned with what matters.

This system gives you structured time to think clearly, act intentionally, and course-correct before drift becomes crisis.

## What To Do Next

1. Open `principles.md` and read it
2. Open `north_star.md` and fill it out
3. Run your first daily check-in today
4. Schedule your first weekly review for this Sunday

That's it. Start small. Build the habit. The system will compound.

*This is a living system. Adjust it as you grow. Delete what doesn't serve you. Add what does. The point is clarity, not compliance.*
